Pre-Placement Optimization 
Improve the logic structure 
Reduce congestion
Reduce area
Improve timing 

Floorplanning and Initial Placement 
The goals of floorplanning and initial placement include the following:

Creating prototypes using multiple iterations with a focus on routability
Moving toward timing-driven placement as routability stabilizes
Adding power routing once timing and congestion converge 

GigaPlace 
As the routability of the floorplan stabilizes, you should shift your focus to placement and preCTS
timing closure based on ideal clocks including:
Setup slack (WNS - Worst Negative Slack)
Design rule violations (DRVs)
Setup times (TNS - Total Negative Slack 

PreCTS optimization is also called by GigaPlace to do more interleaving between placement and
congestion. It leads to better timing and congestion QOR because placement is more aware of
timing and congestion critical areas.
